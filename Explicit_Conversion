#As we saw earlier in the video, some data types can be mixed and matched due to implicit conversion. Implicit conversion is where
#the interpreter helps us out and automatically converts one data type into another, without having to explicitly tell it to do so.
#By contrast, explicit conversion is where we manually convert from one data type to another by calling the relevant function for
#the data type we want to convert to. We used this in our video example when we wanted to print a number alongside some text.
#Before we could do that, we needed to call the str() function to convert the number into a string. Once the number was explicitly
#converted to a string, we could join it with the rest of our textual string and print the result.
#Implicate conversion is when an integer is automatically turned into a float (7 +2.1) 7 is automatically converted into a float.
#Explicit conversion is when you specifically tell the computer to combine two data types such as a string and a float.
